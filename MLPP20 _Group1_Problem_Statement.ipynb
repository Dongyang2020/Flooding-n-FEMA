According to the [congressional budget office](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-04/55019-ExpectedCostsFromWindStorm.pdf), a majority of these losses were the result of flooding. According to ~~the report~~ **(GGD: a report)** from the [NYU Furman Center](https://furmancenter.org/files/Floodplain_PopulationBrief_12DEC2017.pdf), nearly ten percent of the U.S. population ~~live~~ **(GGD: lives)** in floodplains.

Initially, it **(GGD: what is \"it\"?)** was done on an ad-hoc basis through legislation until the Federal Disaster Management Agency was created in 1930. In 1978 it became the independent Federal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA), until 2003, when it was brought under the directive of Homeland Security. The agency is responsible for not only helping during the disasters but also help residents to move out of the vulnerable areas through home buyout programs.

FEMA's mandate is primarily to coordinate responses to overwhelming disasters, but also to provide relief and rebuild in those affected areas. In the past 30 years, the agency has supported buyouts of [43,000 properties](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaax8995), as homeowners look to relocate. For some perspective, one study shows that over [41 million Americans](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaac65) live on *inland* properties that are within the 1% annual exceedance probability floodplain, which means there is a 26% chance it will be flooded [every 30 years](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/floods-and-recurrence-intervals?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects). In addition to these concerns of scale, some studies go so far as to observe that rich counties [are getting more federal help](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/climate/disaster-flood-buyouts-climate-change.html)) in order to cope with natural disasters. Moreover, there is evidence that climate change will increase the [serverity of storms](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/43/21450), and the resulting damages to human life and well-being. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Q66ly4lUSh72","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##Problem Statement(CW, HA, DW, SS)\n","\n","This ~~data analysis~~ **(GGD: project)** will explore the impacts of inland flooding on communities, as viewed through the lens of demographic characteristics and the distribution of federal relief funding.
